This package contains various miscellaneous utilities which belong nowhere
in particular in the Workbench.  Highlights include "Computation", which
implements the 'Computation.WithError' error messages; "ExtendedPrelude",
which includes functions the Haskell prelude designers left out; "Sources",
"Sink" and "Broadcaster", which implement a primitive (but useful) event
mechanism; "WBFiles", which parses command line arguments; and "BinaryAll"
(and the modules it imports), which implements the conversion of values to
binary and back.
