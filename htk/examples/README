uni/htk/examples

This directory contains examples for HTk. Their arrangment is
described in more detail in the "Short Introduction" to HTk, which can
be found at the website http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/htk; that
document should also be your first port of call if you are in need of
introductory information about HTk.

Here's a brief run-down of the organisation of the examples: 

- directory intro contains the examples from the "Short Introduction";

- directory simple contains simple examples (rather unsurprisingly);

- directory canvas contains examples dealing with the canvas widget;

- directory tix contains examples showing how to use the tix widgets
  encapsulated in HTk;

- directory toolkit contains examples of how to use various parts of
  the toolkit;

- directory gengui contains examples of how to use the generic
  graphical user interface GenGUI.
