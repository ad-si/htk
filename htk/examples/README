uni/htk/examples

This directory contains examples for HTk. Their arrangment is
described in more detail in the "Short Introduction" to HTk, which can
be found in ../doc/intro; that document should also be your first port
of call if you are in need of introductory information about HTk.

Here's a brief run-down of the organisation of the examples: 

- directory simple contains simple examples (rather unsurprisingly);
 
- directory canvas contains examples dealing with the canvas widget;

- directory tix contains examples showing how to use the tix widgets
  encapsulated in HTk;

- directory toolkit contains examples of how to use various parts of
  the toolkit;

- directory gengui contains examples of how to use the generic
  graphical user interface GenGUI.
