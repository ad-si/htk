uni/htk/examples

This directory contains a few very short examples, aimed to introduce
a newcomer to HTk and/or Tk to the concept of programming graphical
user interfaces in Haskell using HTk.

Hello{1,2,3}.hs should give you a very first impression of HTk, and in
particular of the way interactors are used to handle user events. They
open a wee window saying "Hello world" (what else could they possibly
say), and add a button to close the window, or change the colour of
the text etc.

ListEx.hs, MenuEx.hs, ReliefEx.hs and TextWidEx.hs introduce the
listbox widgets, the various flavours of menues, reliefs and the
incredibly versatile text widget with its text
annotations. CanvasEx.hs, XmasCanvas.hs and Blobs.hs introduce the
canvas widget (XmasCanvas obviously with a seasonal theme).

IMPORTANT: Note that you need to set the environment variable WB_ROOT
to some directory, which has a subdirectory bin containing an
executable named wish which is (the Tcl/Tk shell) wish (or a link
to it). The standard configuration script sets a link in uni/bin to
this effect; the scrip SET_WB_ROOT sets the environment variable
accordingly.

These programs were first conceived for a course at Uni Bremen introducing
(amongst others) HTk-- if you read German, you can look at the corresponding
slides at http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~cxl/lehre/asp99.
