HTk Buglist
-----------

This file contains a list of known and as-yet unfixed HTk bugs, in
(roughly) descending order of seriousness.

TkVariables [cxl, 17.09.01]
 MenuCheckButtons can have TkVariables of any type. Using e.g. list of
 string leads to 
    Fail: invalid command name "abc"
 presumably as wish tries to a evaluate "[abc]". 
  
Font parsing [ludi, 17.08.01] 
 In resources/Font.hs, in the class instantiation of XFont for Read,
 we may have XFonts which are not parsed correctly (if we do not set
 all fields of the XFont). This is in particular happens in text
 widgets where the font is not specified explicitly-- 
 see examples/MainmarkupTextEx.hs

doFormMust can be closed [amahnke, 28.07.06]
 In toolkit/SimpleForm.hs, the doFormMust function can't deal with
 a close event. When the user doesn't use the OK button but closes the
 window, there is no value to return, so the ghc runtime engine is
 throwing:
 (Pattern match failure in do expression at SimpleForm.hs:376:6-17)
 This kind of form is used in uni/mmiss/test/MainMMiSSWorkbench

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed bugs:

BNo should by a type synonym, not a newtype [cxl]
 kernel/Wish.hs.
Fixed - cxl, 02.02

Text Editors become enabled [mclee, 14.09.01]
  Inserting markup text into a text editor leaves it enabled. The
  insert markup function should leave the text editor in its
  previous state.
Fixed - ludi/cxl, 20.09.01

creadTK can't parse Bool? [cxl/crimson, 21.09.01]
  resources/GUIValue.hs falls over when parsing a Bool. Or it tries to
  parse Bools as something else: 
     do v<- (createTkVariable True):: IO (TkVariable Bool)
        readTkVariable v
   leads to "NO PARSE: True".
Fixed - ludi/cxl, 28.09.01


FileDialog hangs [crimson, 17.08.01]
 If the "create folder" button is clicked, the file dialog does not 
 respond to further interaction; you can only quit. 
Fixed - ludi
