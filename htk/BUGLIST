HTk Buglist
-----------

This file contains a list of known and as-yet unfixed HTk bugs, in
(roughly) descending order of seriousness.

FileDialog hangs [crimson, 17.08.01]
 If the "create folder" button is clicked, the file dialog does not 
 respond to further interaction; you can only quit. 
  
Font parsing [ludi, 17.08.01] 
 In resources/Font.hs, in the class instantiation of XFont for Read,
 we may have XFonts which are not parsed correctly (if we do not set
 all fields of the XFont). This is in particular happens in text
 widgets where the font is not specified explicitly-- 
 see examples/MainmarkupTextEx.hs
