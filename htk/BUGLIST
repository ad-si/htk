HTk Buglist
-----------

This file contains a list of known and as-yet unfixed HTk bugs, in
(roughly) descending order of seriousness.

Radio groups do not deselect [cxl/joel]
  It is possible to have more than one radio button selected in a group.
  See htk/examples/MainmenuEx.hs

Popup-Menus do not work [joel]
  They just don't do anything.

Interactors on unpacked canvas objects behave strange [ludi, 25.01.2001]
  If you set an interactor going on a canvas object which is not yet
  packed, it will behave strangely and continue to do so even after
  the canvas object has been packed.
  
Button interactors crash [cxl/ludi, 08.02.2001]
  If you have an interactor which reacts to a triggered event (e.g. a
  pressed Button), and the button has no Command config option, then 
  the interactor (and all of HTk) crash, even before the button is
  pressed.
