The module ObjectTypes depends on CodedValue depends on View depends on
CodedValue depends on ViewType depends on the types WrappedObjectType and 
WrappedDisplayType.  To break this circularity, we create a DisplayTypes.hi-boot 
file and an ObjectTypes.hi-boot file, as described in the GHC manual ("How to 
compile mutually recursive modules").  These files are themselves produced by 
compiling the files ObjectTypes.boot.hs and DisplayTypes.boot.hs, and moving the 
resulting .hi files.
