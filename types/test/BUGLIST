1)  ghc5.03, Linux, remote, debugging version
    runWorkbench can't even start up and falls over with "no parse" error.

30th May.
    This seems to be a version mismatch in GHC.  It happened also with ghc5.02
    but reinstalling and recompiling GHC fixes it.  The no parse was tracked 
    down to a value of VersionGraphService.FrozenGraph:
FrozenGraph{graphState'=(CannedGraph{updates=[NewNodeType "C" (),NewNodeType "W" (),NewArcType "C" (),NewArcType "W" ()]}),nameSourceBranch'=(NameSourceBranch [4])}

2)  ghc5.02, Solaris, debugging
    HUGE file (libuni-htk.a) causes Server a stack overflow.

30th May.
The ultimate fix to this is to install a better database system for large 
files.  For now we'll have to leave it.
3)  ghc5.02, optimised + unoptimised version, Solaris.
    On closing window in optimised version, nothing else seems to be 
    possible.
