3rd May 2002

1)  ghc5.03, Linux, remote, debugging version
    runWorkbench can't even start up and falls over with "no parse" error.
2)  ghc5.02, Solaris, debugging
    HUGE file (libuni-htk.a) causes Server a stack overflow.
3)  ghc5.02, optimised + unoptimised version, Solaris.
    On closing window in optimised version, nothing else seems to be 
    possible.
