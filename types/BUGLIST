--------------------------------
(3/2002).  HUGE files crash the server
   FIXED 11/6/2002.  We have moved to using the Berkeley DB for storing
   files, and this seems not to have a problem with huge files.  This
   is tested with a 29MB file committed and read back by clients on
   titania calling bob; it takes several seconds but this is not unbearable.
   The main problem with this method is that the whole file needs to be
   put in memory, which increases the virtual set size for the client process.
   If this turns out to be a problem the best solution would be to modify
   simpledb to store files in chunks of, say, 1MB each.
(4/2/2002) Closing a version graph stops other versions responding
   FIXED 3/6/2002
(1/2/2002) Folders display should display the name of the version


It's not exactly clear what fixed what.  The change from cvs alone
was a major one which seems to have fixed some bugs.


Old Bugs
--------
(4/2/2002) Closing a version graph stops other versions responding
(2/2/2002) After committing out an empty version with no changes, unable to
   modify anything.
(1/2/2002) Folders display should display the name of the version

(old)
View.commitView should prevent anyone doing any updates while
it commits.  For this we need a special kind of lock by which
commitView can lock out any updates, but updates can't lock out
each other.


Fixed bugs
----------

(1/2/2002) Things aren't actually saved to the repository (FIXED 2/2)
