(2/2/2002) After committing out an empty version with no changes, unable to
   modify anything.
(1/2/2002) Folders display should display the name of the version

(old)
View.commitView should prevent anyone doing any updates while
it commits.  For this we need a special kind of lock by which
commitView can lock out any updates, but updates can't lock out
each other.


Fixed bugs
----------

(1/2/2002) Things aren't actually saved to the repository (FIXED 2/2)
