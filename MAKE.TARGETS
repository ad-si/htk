Here is the list of Make targets that should work for ghc-6.10.x and ghc-6.12.x.
Of course these will only work when you've run ./configure (which creates
the Makefiles in the first place.)

   cabal - creates all cabal packages globally with profiling
     (which means libraries but not executables)
   testcabal - creates all test and main programs.
     packages must have been made.
   clean - cleans everything
