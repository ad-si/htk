This directory contains Uni, the central part of the UniForM workbench
(that is, minus the repository manager).  The source of Uni is in the
following directories:


   directory    |  contents
   
   mk           |  Makefile magic which set up default rules and variables
   bin          |  Shell scripts which might be needed for building Uni
   util         |  Miscellanous Haskell functions used all over Uni
   concurrency  |  Concurrency functions
   reactor      |  The Reactor, for gluings processes together
   htk          |  This is an encapsulation of Tcl/Tk in Haskell
   davinci      |  This is an encapsulation of DaVinci in Haskell
   www          |  Functions for manipulating HTML in Haskell

It is intended to make the remainder of UniForM available later on.
However the repository manager is currently in a very unsatisfactory
state and needs a great deal more work before this can be done.  However
we hope this fragment will be of interest to show what the guts of a
real Haskell program look like.

Requirements
------------

The following are required or at least recommended. 
(1) A Unix box (probably it has to be Linux/x86 or Solaris).  Nearly
    all development has been done on Solaris so that is most likely to
    work.
(2) gcc.  Ideally what I use -- gcc version 2.95.1.
    Do not use 2.8* versions since they are known not to work at all with 
    Glasgow Haskell.  Version 2.71 might work but I suspect Glasgow Haskell 
    will not support it for much longer.
(3) gmake.  Again, use the latest one - 3.77.  But I think slightly earlier
    ones may well work.
(4) The very latest version of Glasgow Haskell.  This means downloading
    the binary release (version 4.5) for your machine, getting the sources
    from Glasgow Haskell's anoncvs repository (which is updated every evening)
    and then using the binary release to bootstrap compiling the sources.
    This is a painful process which is already done for you for Solaris.
    The latest version for Solaris should be in 
       /usr/local/pub-bkb/ghc/ghc-latest
    and the sources should be in 
       /usr/local/pub-bkb/ghc/fptools.

Alter mk/machinedep.mk as appropriate.  (At the moment the variables
are set for Sparc/Solaris boxes on the Informatik network.) 

Of course you also need the sources to Uni!  They should be with this
README file, but in case they are not, or in case you want to update
your copies, here are details.  The Uni sources are kept in a 
CVS repository in /home/uniform/repository.  So for example to get
a complete set of the latest version of the sources you type (on the 
Informatik network)

   export CVSROOT=/home/uniform/repository
   cvs checkout uni

Type "man cvs" to find out other CVS commands.

Compiling
---------

Once you've got all that, compiling Uni and the test programs that
come with it should be easy.  The following commands are supposed to do
it, assuming that you are in the same directory as this README file
(that is, at the top of the Uni distribution).
   
# Configure file system
./CONFIG
# Work out what order to do compilation in
gmake depend
# Compile Uni
gmake all
# Compile test programs
gmake testprgs

Please report problems to me.  I am George Russell and my e-mail
address is ger@tzi.de .

Good luck!
