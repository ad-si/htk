License Agreement

Preamble

The aim of this licence agreement is to enable the free use of the
software that is described in the sequel by anyone. In order to
guarantee this, it is necessary to set up rules for the use of the
software that hold for any user.

Provider of this licence is the University of Bremen, represented by
its principal (called "licence provider" in the sequel). The provider
of the licence has developed the "Uniform Workbench" (just
called "software" in the sequel). The software includes a
graphical tool for accessing documents stored in a versioned repository,
but also contains libraries and some other tools.

Following the ideas of open source software, the licence provider
gives access to the software without fee for anyone (called "licence
taker" in the sequel) under the following conditions which are similar
to the Lesser Gnu Public License (LGPL). Each licence taker obligates
himself to follow the terms of use below.



1 Principle

Each licence taker appreciating these terms of use receives a simple
right, not resctricted in time and space and without any fee, to use
the software, in particular, to copy, distribute and process
it. Exclusively the following terms of use do hold.  The licence
provider explicitly contradicts any conflicting terms of business. By
making use of the rights described below, in particular by copying or
distributing it, a licence treaty between the licence provider and the
licence takes is concluded.



2 Copying

The licence taker has the right to make and distribute unmodified
copies of the software on any media. Prerequisite for this is that the
licence provider and this licence agreement is clearly recognizable,
and that the sources are distributed together with the software.



3 Modification and Distribution

The licence taker has the right to modify copies of the software (or
parts thereof) and to distribute these modifications under the terms
of 2 above and the following conditions:

1. The modified software has to carry a clear mark that points to the
original licence provider, the modification that has been made, and
the date of the modification.

2. The licence taker has to ensure that the software as a whole or
parts of it are accessible to third parties under the terms of this
licence agreement without fee.

3. If during the modification a copyright of the licence taker
emerges, then this copyright must be put under the terms of this
licence if the modified software is distributed.


4 Other duties

1. Reference to the validity of this licence agreement must not be
modified or deleted by the licence taker.

2. The use of the software by third parties must not be conditioned by
the fulfilment of duties that are not mentioned in this licence
agreement.

3. The use of the software must not be prevented or complicated by
means fo technical protection, in particular copy protection means.



5 Liability, Update

1. Liability of the licence provider is restriced to fraudulent
withheld factual or legal errors. The licence provider does not give
any warranty, and neither ensures any properties of the
software. Furthermore, he is liable only for those damages that are
caused by willful or grossly negligent violation of duty.

2. The licence provider has the right to update these terms of use at
any time.




6 Forum for users

The licence provider does provide neither support nor
consultation. Without acknowledgement of any legal duty, the licence
provider will care about the installation of a user forum for
discussions about the software and its further development.


7 Legal domicile

for this licence agreement. For any lawsuits or legal actions emerging
from this licence agreement, it is agreed that exclusively German
courts are competent. Legal domicile is Bremen.

rights of use of the offender.

validity of the other rules is not affected. The parties will care
about replacing the invalid rule by some valid rule that comes close
to the purpose of this agreement.
