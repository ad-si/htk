Bug and to-do list for MMiSS Workbench
--------------------------------------

Xml standard == "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"
(available from W3C).

23) 06.09.02
Alter mmiss/test/runWorkbench and Makefile.in so that all the users temporary 
files go in the current directory or in /tmp/uni.temp.[USERNAME], thus making
it less likely that different people using the same machine will get into
trouble because their files get in each other way.
FIXED

22) 04.09.02
Incorporate mmiss/parser into the source-file hierarchy, and add an
interface specification for it.
FIXED

21) 04.09.02
On editing file get message
Fail: EmacsBasic: XEmacs error: (error Cannot modify start of a buffer) in command (uni-add-container-buffer "Npara1")

This is the first time this has occurred and it seems to be erratic.
So I'll see if it occurs again (and hope it doesn't).

20) 04.09.02
Collapsing an item in the editor doesn't turn off its read lock.
Solution: put call to finishEdit in.
FIXED

19) 04.09.02
mmiss/test/{Makefile.in,runWorkbench.in} altered so that location of
temporary
 files depends on user.
FIXED

18) 04.09.02
Compiled unoptimised with Linux doesn't start at all but produces
a message saying "Prelude.read: no parse". 

Turns out to be a concurrency bug in the Server code.
FIXED

17) 04.09.02
Compiled optimised with Linux we get a segmentation fault when trying to
display version graph.

Also true when unoptimised, at least after fix for 18 has been applied.
At least that should make it easier to debug.

06.09.02
Investigation reveals that this occurs during bdbclient.c's function
db_retrieve, when it calls the BDB function DB->get.  This then
(perhaps indirectly) calls the BDB function __dbcl_db_get,
in rpc_client/gen_client.c, which in turn calls the XDR function xdr_free
which executes xdr___db_get_reply in rpc_server/db_server_xdr.c.
This calls xdr_bytes on a pointer to the value returned (to free it presumably,
though why this should be necessary I don't know), with the function call
"xdr_bytes(xdrs, (char **)&objp->datadata.datadata_val, (u_int *) &objp->datadata.datadata_len, ~0))".
It is this which falls over; it looks as if it is attempting to free something
that wasn't malloc'd, or has already been free'd.

Temporary workaround: for Linux, set the environment variable MALLOC_CHECK_
when the workbench is running.  In the long term this will have to be reported
to the maintainers of BDB I suppose.

FIXED temporarily.

16) 04.09.02
Totally useless puthash commands in emacs/extents.el corrected (as the
arguments were wrong) and commented out (as puthash should already have
been done).
FIXED

15) 04.09.02
Clicking magic button in dtd/mmiss-paragraph.1.xml (a) fails because it
claims the file is already being edited when it isn't; (b) fails to put button
back when it has failed.
(b) is due to EmacsEdit.openFile not returning a success code and no-one
being prepared to handle its failure; now fixed.

(a) is a silly typo in MMiSSObjects.
FIXED

14) 02.09.02
Intermittently VersionGraph does not start up properly.

03.09.02
After a lengthy investigation it turns out that the reason is that
after ChildProcess.newChildProcess does Posix.forkProcess, we now have
various worker threads doing things like communicating with the server
in both the child and parent process, until the child process manages to
exexve the new process.  This bug has been around ever since Einar's day
at least, but has only emerged now (and partially in item 11) because
I would guess of either the increased complexity (and number of worker threads)
of MMiSSWorkbench, or changes in ghc5.04's scheduler.

This has necessitated a complete rewrite of ChildProcess.newChildProcess's
mechanism for starting a new process, converting it from Haskell into C.
But it's worth it, and the problem seems to be 
FIXED

13) 28.08.02
DTD needs to be modified to allow includes everywhere where atoms and other
insertable items can appear.

Solution agreed 02.09.02.
FIXED

12) 28.08.02
   The button inside dtd/mmiss-paragraph.1.xml is getting inserted into
   the Emacs buffer with the wrong name.  From w.debug:
XEmacs>(MMiSS-init)
XEmacs>(uni-add-container-buffer "Npara1")
XEmacs>(uni-add-button "Npara1" "Hpara1" "para1")
XEmacs>(uni-add-text "Npara1" "<paragraph label=\"para1\"\n  >")
XEmacs>(uni-add-button "Npara1" "Npara1" "para1")
XEmacs>(uni-add-text "Npara1" "</paragraph>")
XEmacs>(uni-bound-container "Npara1")
   so it is wrongly called Npara1, duplicating the name of the container.

04.09.02.
This turns out to be a really simple typo in EmacsEdit.hs.  If only all bugs
were as easy to remove as this.

FIXED

11) 27.08.02
For some reason the workbench has started having trouble
starting daVinci.  If it still happens tomorrow maybe I'll have
to fix it . . 

Output is as follows:

Attempt to start daVinci from path "/home/ger/bin/daVinci" failed
Unexpected response was "Tk: can't re"

28.08.02.  It happened, and is hopefully now fixed.  After extensive
investigation, and help from Mattias, it seems that the Posix.executeFile
function called by ChildProcess and used to start daVinci somehow pangles
unevaluated environment and argument values.  Why this has only been noticed
now I don't know; perhaps something to do with the large size of the 
executable?  
FIXED but see item (14).

10) 27.08.02
Need to alter MMiSSContent/MMiSSObjects to handle both links and references.

9) 27.08.02
Error "Writing textFrag1: Expected an textFragment but found a textFrag1"
Clearly confusing names and xml tags.

Seems to be a bug in MMiSSObjects.simpleWriteToMMiSSObject.
FIXED I hope

8) 27.08.02
Sometimes it seems to hang and nothing is displayed.  w.debug ends
by adding the daVinci rules.  This can usually be "fixed" by trying
again later.  It may only happen when we restart immediately after
quitting.

See item (14).
FIXED

7) 27.08.02
Improved error handling for bad/non-existent. UNIMMISSDTD files.
FIXED

6) 27.08.02
Message "Fail: handleEvents: container NtextFrag1 does not exist"
when quitting after an edit.  Quit does not complete.
FIXED

5) 27.08.02
Choosing "Exit daVinci" from the View menu causes a rather untidy exit.

4) 27.08.02
MMiSSContents.structureContents changed to allow an error to be returned;
MMiSSObjects changed to handle it.
FIXED

3) 26.08.02.  
"Fail: Top-level in Xml does not have a label attribute" when importing
new object.
FIXED see (4).

2)
We assume object names match the NAME production, or that HaXml doesn't notice
if they don't, EG in MMiSSEditXml.hs.  (Compare with sections 3.3.1 and 2.3
of Xml standard).

1)
When editing and we enlarge an object, we always take the variant attributes
of the top object (being edited), not those of any sub-object.
