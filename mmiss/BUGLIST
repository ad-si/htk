Buglist for MMiSS Workbench
---------------------------

Xml standard == "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"
(available from W3C).

5) 27.08.02
Choosing "Exit daVinci" from the View menu causes a rather untidy exit.

4) 27.08.02
MMiSSContents.structureContents changed to allow an error to be returned;
MMiSSObjects changed to handle it.

3) 26.08.02.  
"Fail: Top-level in Xml does not have a label attribute" when importing
new object.

2)
We assume object names match the NAME production, or that HaXml doesn't notice
if they don't, EG in MMiSSEditXml.hs.  (Compare with sections 3.3.1 and 2.3
of Xml standard).

1)
When editing and we enlarge an object, we always take the variant attributes
of the top object (being edited), not those of any sub-object.
