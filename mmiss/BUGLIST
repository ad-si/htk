Bug and to-do list for MMiSS Workbench
--------------------------------------

Xml standard == "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"
(available from W3C).

11) 27.08.02
For some reason the workbench has started having trouble
starting daVinci.  If it still happens tomorrow maybe I'll have
to fix it . . 

Output is as follows:

Attempt to start daVinci from path "/home/ger/bin/daVinci" failed
Unexpected response was "Tk: can't re"

10) 27.08.02
Need to alter MMiSSContent/MMiSSObjects to handle both links and references.

9) 27.08.02
Error "Writing textFrag1: Expected an textFragment but found a textFrag1"
Clearly confusing names and xml tags.

Seems to be a bug in MMiSSObjects.simpleWriteToMMiSSObject.
FIXED I hope

8) 27.08.02
Sometimes it seems to hang and nothing is displayed.  w.debug ends
by adding the daVinci rules.  This can usually be "fixed" by trying
again later.  It may only happen when we restart immediately after
quitting.

7) 27.08.02
Improved error handling for bad/non-existent. UNIMMISSDTD files.
FIXED

6) 27.08.02
Message "Fail: handleEvents: container NtextFrag1 does not exist"
when quitting after an edit.  Quit does not complete.
FIXED

5) 27.08.02
Choosing "Exit daVinci" from the View menu causes a rather untidy exit.

4) 27.08.02
MMiSSContents.structureContents changed to allow an error to be returned;
MMiSSObjects changed to handle it.
FIXED

3) 26.08.02.  
"Fail: Top-level in Xml does not have a label attribute" when importing
new object.
FIXED see (4).

2)
We assume object names match the NAME production, or that HaXml doesn't notice
if they don't, EG in MMiSSEditXml.hs.  (Compare with sections 3.3.1 and 2.3
of Xml standard).

1)
When editing and we enlarge an object, we always take the variant attributes
of the top object (being edited), not those of any sub-object.
