Buglist for MMiSS objects
-------------------------

Xml standard == "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"
(available from W3C).

1)
When editing and we enlarge an object, we always take the variant attributes
of the top object (being edited), not those of any sub-object.  
(7th August 2002)

2)
We assume object names match the NAME production, or that HaXml doesn't notice
if they don't, EG in MMiSSEditXml.hs.  (Compare with sections 3.3.1 and 2.3
of Xml standard).
