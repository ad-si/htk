Installation instruction for the mmiss-checker tool:
====================================================

1) Description: 
===============

The miss-checker tool is designed to check MMISS-XML files
with respect to: 

  o references in the file, that are required must occur in the 
    same file
  o the graph of references inside definitions to other definitions 
    must be acyclic. 


2) Installation: 
================

Requirements: 
-------------
This installation has been tested with the following versions
of autoconf, gmake and lisp. 

 - autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57
 - GNU Make 3.80
 - CMU Common Lisp 18e 

CMU Common Lisp 18e is freely available from the CMU Common Lisp 
website at www.cons.org/cmucl.


Installation: 
-------------

To install the mmiss-checker, proceed as follows from
the directory where this README file is after unpacking 
the tar-file. 

 cd src
 autoconf 
 ./configure --with-lisp=path2lisp-binary
 gmake all

This will install the miss-checker executable in a new
directory bin, adjacent to the src directory. 


Installation Example: 
---------------------

In the following example we assume the lisp binary to be CMU Common Lisp 
(Version >= 18e) to be at: /share/languages/lisp/linux/cmucl18e/bin/lisp

 cd src
 autoconf
 ./configure --with-lisp=/share/languages/lisp/linux/cmucl18e/bin/lisp 
 gmake all


3) Running the checker:
=======================

Execute from the bin directory created by the installation: 

mmiss-checker miss-xml-file.xml references
