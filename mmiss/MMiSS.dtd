<!-- System Attributes 
     These attributes contain information which the Workbench is going to
     need to access or create.   Theresefore, changing them will require
     corresponding changes to the sources of the Workbench, particularly
     to the file MMiSSDTDAssumptions.hs, but maybe also elsewhere.

<!-- 
   "object-class" describes the particular sort of group, unit or atom
      we are dealing with, for example "chapter", "theorem", or whatever. 
   "label" and "packagePath" describe the location of the object within
      the package.  Specifically, "packagePath" describes its actual location,
      and "label" describes the name used to search for it.  These will be
      the same, unless the object was renamed upon import.  When they are the
      same, "packagePath" may be omitted.
   "priority" should be an integer.   It is normally used to mark "home"
      inserts, so that if for example a unit is included once in its home
      position, and once elsewhere, references in output files go to the
      "home".  In general "home" inserts are 1 and others are 0, but in 
      general they can be set by the user, and links and references within
      the document should go to the unit with the highest priority (or one
      of them selected arbitrarily, if there are several).
   "packageId" identifies the package this comes from.  The exact format
      of this is irrelevant; all that matters is which packageIds in an
      object are the same, so that when we import a file and break it up,
      we can tell which elements belong to the top package.
   "files" is a list (separated by spaces) of all files included by this
      element.
