How to connect to the MMiSS server
==================================

Initial Login
-------------

The client and server both use a primitive string format during authentication.
Namely, a single byte containing the length of the string, which must be
at most 127, followed by the bytes of the string itself.  (This means that
when prompting for the user's user-id and password, the client should fault
any that are too long.)

(1) The client should connect to the server on whatever port the user 
specifies; the default should be 11396.

The client should then send the following three strings to the server:
(a) "MMiSS-XML";
(b) the user-id;
(c) the password.

(2) The server will then send back either
(a) the string "OK", if the login attempt succeeded
or
(b) a string beginning "ERROR: " followed by an explanatory message
(which should be displayed).

If login does not succeed the server will close the connection.

Processing XML instructions
---------------------------

If login succeeded, we are ready to process MMiSS requests, formatted according
to MMiSSRequest.dtd.  The client should repeatedly send <request> elements.
Each time it does this, the server should respond with a <response> element.

The client should parse the <response> element.  In particular the <messages>
element should be communicated to the user, if non-empty.   If it contains
status=panic, the client should not send any more requests to the server,
and the server may drop the connection.

When the client has finished, it should drop the connection.
