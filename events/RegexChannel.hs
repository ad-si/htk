-- | RegexChannel provides Expect-like pattern matching on
-- a channel.  Regular expression matching is done by GNU regex,
-- via RegexString.
-- 
-- Problems I will admit to:
-- (1) Since GNU regex is effectively a black box, there is no
--     indexing - we must check every regex against every string.
--     This is theoretically bad, because there ought to be 
--     some way of constructing a finite-state-automaton which
--     selects the right alternative.  
-- (2) Because of the way GuardedChannels work, we can't
--     get out the extra information from the matching
--     (like, the match substrings).  So if we want them,
--     they have to be recomputed.
-- Note the following difference from Einar's Expect:
--    priorities are not available, instead you should put your
--    most important events at the left in +> expressions.
--    If this seems feeble, my excuse is that you had to do this
--    anyway with Einar's expect if you wanted the priorities to
--    work, so the priorities were redundant.
