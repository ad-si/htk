-- | A DeleteQueue is a queue where entries can be deleted by an
-- IO action.  This is a fairly specialised implementation, designed
-- for event handling.
-- 
-- Queue entries are either active or invalid.  Once invalid,
-- removeQueue will not return them, but they still take up (a little) memory.
-- 
-- addQueue, removeQueue, isEmptyQueue, cleanQueue all take a delete queue
-- as argument.  We assume that this argument is not used again.
-- 
-- Either removeQueue or isEmptyQueue or cleanQueue should be run 
-- occasionally, to remove invalid entries.
module DeleteQueue(
   DeleteQueue,
   emptyQueue, -- :: DeleteQueue v
   addQueue, -- :: DeleteQueue v -> v -> IO (DeleteQueue v,IO ())
   -- add an item to the queue, returning the new queue + a new action which
   -- will invalidate that item.
   removeQueue, 
   -- :: DeleteQueue v -> IO (Maybe (v,DeleteQueue v,DeleteQueue v))
   -- returns the next active element of the queue, and the succeeding
   -- queue.  3rd result is a queue which is identical to the original
   -- queue.
   isEmptyQueue, -- :: DeleteQueue v -> IO (Maybe (DeleteQueue v))
   -- If queue has active entries, returns it, otherwise return Nothing.
   cleanQueue, -- :: DeleteQueue v -> IO (DeleteQueue v)
